/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for YU Playbook.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and coaching logs,
 * an instructor-ownership model for coaching programs, and open access for tournaments,
 * teams, and matches.  All write operations are strictly controlled based on user
 * authentication and explicit authorization checks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, owned by the user. Contains role field.
 * - /tournaments/{tournamentId}: Tournament information, publicly readable.
 * - /coachingPrograms/{coachingProgramId}: Coaching programs, owned by the instructor.
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Team data, publicly readable.
 * - /teams/{teamId}/joinRequests/{userId}: Join requests, created by users, managed by coaches.
 * - /teams/{teamId}/announcements/{announcementId}: Announcements, created by coach, readable by all.
 * - /teams/{teamId}/events/{eventId}: Events, created by coach, readable by all.
 * - /tournaments/{tournamentId}/matches/{matchId}: Match details, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/coachingLogs/{coachingLogId}: Coaching logs, owned by the user and accessible by the coach.
 * - /users/{userId}/tournamentHistory/{tournamentHistoryId}: Tournament history, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/goals/{goalId}: Personal development goals, owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Open read access is granted to tournaments, teams, and matches to facilitate data sharing.
 * - The instructorId and coachId are stored within the CoachingProgram and CoachingLog documents, respectively,
 *   to enable authorization checks without additional reads.
 * - Admin-only write access for critical collections like tournaments and matches.
